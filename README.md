# Html-Refactoring-Challenge

## Description
This repository is designed to help us modify code given to us to refactor and meet an acceptance criteria in a project based environment. We were given an index and css file that contained many classes that were deemed unnessecary with the use of proper semantic elements, and deletion of excess/repetitive code.

## Installation
* Most recent version of VS code
* Develop file cloned from github user [@Xandromus.](https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram)



## Usage

This assignment can be used as an example for using semantic elements in conjunction with a base for how a sample website should look for future projects.
